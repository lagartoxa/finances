# Finances
TODO: find a better name xD


# Description
Project I made to control my own finances and also study React and FastAPI.


# How to Install
```
$ ./install
```


# How to Run
```
$ ./run_backend.sh
$ ./run_frontend.sh
```

**ATTENTION: ** Since my main goal here is to study React and FastAPI, I made the scripts as simple as possible.
