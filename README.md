# Finances
TODO: find a better name xD


# Description
Project I made to control my own finances and also study React and FastAPI.


# How to Install
```
$ ./install
```

**ATTENTION: ** The scripts don't check many things neither handle all the errors properly. Since my main goal here is to study React and FastAPI, I made them as simple as possible


# How to Run
```
$ ./run.sh
```
